# ConvNet
ConvNet to perform image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

We trained a CNN adding various types of regularization including dropout, weight decay and data augmentation. We steadily increased the depth of the network by adding more convolutional layers.
We trained the network both with an SGD optimizer and with Adam to explore whether this leads to faster convergence. We also explored the number of convolution layers and size of filters required to obtain more accurate ConvNet architectures.
